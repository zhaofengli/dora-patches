# AOSP patches for dora

This repo includes patches necessary to build AOSP 8.0 for Sony Xperia X
Performance (dora/f8131/f8132). I don't actually have the device to test the 
build, so YMMV.

## Configurations

This set of patches has been verified to build successfully with:

- Tree: android-8.0.0_r11
- Combo: aosp_f8131-userdebug
- Targets: bootimage, systemimage
- Setup: https://developer.sonymobile.com/open-devices/aosp-build-instructions/how-to-build-aosp-oreo-for-unlocked-xperia-devices/
